This folder contains the implemantation of libglyr.
All subfolders implement a getter: cover,lyrics,ainfo (..)
A corrsponding .c file (cover.c, lyrics.c, ainfo.c... ) implement the getter itself. 
All other files implement the general webscraping abilities of glyr.
Start reading src/main.c:main() to get through it.. Good luck! :-)
