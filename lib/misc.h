    /**
    * glyr_levenshtein_strcmp:
    * @string: first string to compare
    * @other: second string to compare
    *
    * Computes the levenshtein distance betwenn @string and @other.
    * See Also: http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein-Distanz
    *
    * In very simple words this means: glyr_levenshtein_strcmp() checks if two
    * string are 'similar', the similarity is returned as int from
    * 0 (== total match) to MAX(strlen(string),strlen(other))
    *
    * This is fully UTF-8 aware and calls g_utf8_normalize() beforehand.
    *
    * Example:
    * <note>
    * <para>
    * Equilibrium <=> Aqquilibrim
    * will return 3 since:
    * Equilibrium -> Aquilibrium // one Edit:   'E' -> 'A'
    *
    * Aquilibrium -> Aquilibrim  // one Delete: 'u' -> ''
    *
    * Aquilibrim  -> Aqquilibrim // one Insert: ''  -> 'q'
    *
    * </para>
    * </note>
    *
    * Returns: the levenshtein distance (number of Edits, Deletes and Inserts needed to turn string to other)

    /**
    * glyr_levenshtein_strnormcmp:
    * @string: first string to compare
    * @other: second string to compare
    *
    * Same as levenshtein_strcmp, but tries to normalize the two strings as
    * best as it can (includes strdown, stripping html,
    * utf8 normalization, stripping stuff like (CD 1)
    * and Clapton, Eric -> Eric Clapton
    *
    * For very small strings the function may return very high values in order
    * to prevent accidental matches. See below.
    *
    * internally glyr_levenshtein_strcmp() is used, so this is UTF-8 aware as well.
    *
    * Example:
    * <note>
    * <para>
    * Adios <=> Wei√ü or 19 <=> 21 return 4 or 2 for glyr_levenshtein_strcmp()
    * (and may pass a max threshold of e.g. 4),
    * but a lot higher value with glyr_levenshtein_strnormcmp()
    * </para>
    * </note>
    *
    * Returns: the levenshtein distance
