h2. SWIG BINDINGS

Glyr provides a interface file (generic_glyr.i) to provide bindings for languages other than C/C++
To generate the wrapping code you should install SWIG and the devel headers of your scripting language.
(+ all dependecies of glyr..)

Currently these languages have "supported" bindings:
* Python
* Ruby

Each of them have a subdirectory here.
