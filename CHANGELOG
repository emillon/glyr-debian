2011/03/14

2011/03/17
----------
+ Fixed very ugly stringop.c - Many functions should be faster and smoother now.

+ Fixed an ugly bug in photos.c that crashed libglyr if ignoring a URL
+ added provider photos:google
+ reformatted due to trying anjuta as IDE (instead of pure gVim)

2011/03/18
----------
+ Replaced ugly remove_html_tags with a more generic version that works completely in-place
+ Removed a few redundant strlen()s
+ added (non-working) albumlist getter which gets all official albums from a certain artist

2011/03/19
----------
+ made albumlist getter working. Wohoo.
+ Fixed dumb shortcut bug in glyrc
+ Made finalize() of ainfo,similiar,review,tracklist,albumlist generic, i.e. only call the same function

2011/03/24
----------
+ Fixed crash when libcurl put an error to stdout (ouch..)
+ Fixed google names when having spaces (ouch x 2)

2011/03/28
----------
+ Did a lot of fixing regarding the API
+ Fixed "broken" review getter. Still slow; needs more sources.
+ Extended src/example.c to use more functions.
+ Tested API (It works, biaatch!)

2011/03/29
----------
+ Made 'return GLYRE_STOP_BY_CB;' work.
+ removed Gly_infoat, it was only for devs..

2011/05/15
----------
Found some time to work a bit here :-)
+ Added support for google translator (new 'gtrans' getter), lyrics/text can bew translated directly now.
  It is a bit restricted atm. as only 100.000 chars are allowed per day per IP address. But I already 
  requested more. (20x times as much), hopefully it will get through. Also language detecting works.
+ Glyr does now checksumming. This is useful for developers which want to make sure the data is unique.
  For normal users: Well, the duplicate check is now as fast as rmlint :-P
+ getopt_long is now getopt_long_only (no --arguments, just -argument or -a)
+ removed call_direct. It's of no use. Not even for devs.

2011/05/16
----------
+ removed wikipedia.c for ainfo - never worked. Better provide a link and (relation getter) and let the user render the site (too many information would get lost if glyr would need to parse it)

2011/06/14
----------
+ added support for proxy. (only basic libcurl support, should be suffiecient for 99% of all cases)
+ made API *much* slicker & nicer

2011/06/25
----------
